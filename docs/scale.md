## Scale 

This folder contains script that are used in order to test the scalability of our backend.

- The **scalep.py** is used to test the python impplentation.
- The **scalen.py** is used to test the node impplentation.

You can change the for loop to increase or decrease the number of requests sent to the server and see how the backend will handle them.
